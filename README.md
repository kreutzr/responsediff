# responsediff

ResponseDiff is a Java based regression testing tool that compares the response of a reference installation with that of a candidate (software under test) installation.
Found difference may be marked as intended by the tester for later tests.
It also supports functional testing (e.g., expected values) and non-functional testing (e.g., maximum response times).

Values received in one response may be used as parameters for following requests. Parameters may also read from a file or database for mass data testing.
