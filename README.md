# responsediff

ResponseDiff is a Java based regression testing tool that compares the response of a reference installation with that of a candidate (software under test) installation.
Found differences may be marked as intended (and may be given a reference to a ticket) by the tester for later tests.
It also supports functional testing (e.g., expected values) and non-functional testing (e.g., maximum response times).

Values received in one response may be used as parameters for following requests. Parameters may also read from a file or database for mass data testing.

All tests performed are gathered in an autogenerated report (Asciidoc and PDF by default). 
The entire raw data (variabales, requests and respones) is made available for further inspection as XML.
